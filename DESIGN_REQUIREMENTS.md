# Website Design Requirements for amenocturne.space

## Project Overview

Personal website for Aleksandr, a functional programmer and sound designer. The
site serves as a professional hub showcasing software development (Scala), sound
design, presentations, photography, and productivity tools.

**Domain:** amenocturne.space (from French "âme nocturne" - night soul)

## Brand Identity & Vibe

- **Core aesthetic:** Dark, sophisticated, slightly mystical but professionally grounded
- **Personality:** Evening/twilight atmosphere without being overly nocturnal
- **Professional positioning:** Intersection of technical precision and creative expression
- **Key phrase:** "finds beauty in both elegant algorithms and carefully crafted soundscapes"

## Content Strategy

**Hero section intro:** "I'm Aleksandr — a developer and sound designer who
finds beauty in both elegant algorithms and carefully crafted soundscapes. I
write functional code, design immersive audio environments, and create stunning
presentations that bridge technical concepts with human experience."

**Navigation sections:** Software Development, Sound Design, Projects

## Design Requirements

### Colors

- **Base:** Almost black backgrounds (not completely black)
- **Text:** Pure white primary text

### Typography

- **Priorities:** 1. Elegant, 2. Confident, 3. Organic, 4. Clean
- **Avoid:** Too clean/sterile fonts, overly technical monospace-only designs
- **Balance:** Professional but not bland, readable but distinctive

### Visual Style

- **Likes:** Glassmorphism effects (without gradients), dark elegance, sophisticated layouts
- **Dislikes:** Tech-heavy/developer-only aesthetics, gradient overuse, generic corporate look
- **Inspiration:** Professional sites with subtle mystical undertones, evening/twilight mood

### Layout & Composition

- **Style:** Asymmetrical and dynamic
- **Focus:** Typography as art, smart use of whitespace
- **Sections:** Focus on single main screen initially

### Content Hierarchy

- **Name integration:** "Aleksandr" should be embedded in text flow, not dominant
- **Main focus:** Descriptive text should be the star visual element
- **Highlights:** Key creative/technical keywords (algorithms, soundscapes, functional code, audio environments) should be visually distinct

## Technical Notes

- Responsive design essential
- Clean navigation between specialized portfolios
- Focus on showcasing intersection of technical and creative skills

## Professional Positioning

50/50 split between creative portfolio and professional landing page. Emphasizes
being a creative person who leverages strong programming and math abilities for
creative expression, treating programming and math as creative disciplines.
